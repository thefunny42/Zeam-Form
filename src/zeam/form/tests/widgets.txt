Widgets are responsible to render component as HTML code for the user.


Widget
------

Widgets are multiadapters, which adapts the component they render, for
a given form, and request. So we need all that:

   >>> from zope.publisher.browser import TestRequest
   >>> request = TestRequest()

   >>> from zeam.form.form import Form
   >>> f1 = Form(None, request)

   >>> from zeam.form.actions import Action
   >>> a1 = Action(u"Do Something")
   >>> f1.actions += a1

So now we can get a widget for an action for instance:

   >>> from zeam.form import interfaces
   >>> from zope import component
   >>> w1 = component.getMultiAdapter(
   ...         (a1, f1, request), interfaces.IWidget)
   >>> w1
   <ActionWidget Do Something>

By default our widget will the same title than the component, and its
identifier will be composed with the component on and the form prefix:

   >>> a1.identifier
   'do-something'
   >>> w1.identifier
   'form.do-something'
   >>> a1.title
   u'Do Something'
   >>> w1.title
   u'Do Something'

The method render gives you the HTML to display. Our widget is an
action, so by default you get a button:

   >>> print w1.render()
   <input type="submit" id="form-do-something"
          name="form.do-something" value="Do Something" />
   <BLANKLINE>

You can get its HTML id as well (to render any label for instance):

   >>> w1.htmlId()
   'form-do-something'

Our widget implements IWidget, and IComponent:

   >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyObject
   >>> verifyObject(interfaces.IWidget, w1)
   True
   >>> interfaces.IWidget.extends(interfaces.IComponent)
   True


Widgets
-------

As you can guess, you are not going to build your widgets one by one
to render them. You can a Widgets collection to create and manage your
widgets.

Let's a an another action to our form, and let's create widgets for
them:

   >>> f1.actions += Action("Do Nothing")
   >>> list(f1.actions)
   [<Action Do Something>, <Action Do Nothing>]

   >>> from zeam.form.widgets import Widgets
   >>> ws1 = Widgets(f1.actions, form=f1, request=request)
   >>> ws1
   <Widgets>
   >>> list(ws1)
   [<ActionWidget Do Something>, <ActionWidget Do Nothing>]

Widgets implements IWidgets and ICollection:

   >>> verifyObject(interfaces.IWidgets, ws1)
   True
   >>> interfaces.IWidgets.extends(interfaces.ICollection)
   True


WidgetExtractor
---------------

Widget can render a component to HTML, but it is not their job to
extract values from a request back to a component. It's the job of a
WidgetExtractor, which might be called before the Widget is even
created.

Widget and WidgetExtractor will often work together, as the extractor
need to correctly extract the information from the request.

This design prevent widgets to cache the value they are going to
render when an action might have changed it, like it's done in other
form frameworks design. To be sure that an action doesn't change any
value to render, they are all executed before any widget is created
(even in the case of subforms).

So WidgetExtractor are multiadapters, adapting the component, form and
request, like a Widget does:

   >>> e1 = component.getMultiAdapter(
   ...         (a1, f1, request), interfaces.IWidgetExtractor)
   >>> e1
   <zeam.form.widgets.WidgetExtractor object at ...>

And you can extract the widget value, and errors from the request:

   >>> e1.extract()
   (<Marker NO_VALUE>, None)

But our request was empty here. Let's try with a non-empty one:

   >>> submitted_request = TestRequest(
   ...         form={'form.do-something': u'Do Something',
   ...                'otherfield': 42})
   >>> e2 = component.getMultiAdapter(
   ...         (a1, f1, submitted_request), interfaces.IWidgetExtractor)
   >>> e2.extract()
   (u'Do Something', None)

An another of the extractor is to gives the request fields used for
the extraction:

   >>> e2.extractRaw()
   {'form.do-something': u'Do Something'}

This can be used by widgets to display again any non-validated data.

WidgetExtractor implements IWidgetExtractor, but inlike Widgets, not
IComponent:

   >>> verifyObject(interfaces.IWidgetExtractor, e1, e2)
   True
   >>> interfaces.IComponent.providedBy(e1)
   False
