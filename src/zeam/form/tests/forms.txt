zeam.form
=========

Forms are class, registered like views:

   >>> from zeam.form.form import Form

   >>> from zope.publisher.browser import TestRequest
   >>> request = TestRequest()

   >>> class Context(object):
   ...     pass
   >>> context = Context()

   >>> f1 = Form(context, request)
   >>> f1
   <zeam.form.form.Form object at ...>


They implement IForm:

   >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyObject
   >>> from zeam.form import interfaces


verifyObject(interfaces.IForm, f1)
True
